<b>Challenge 1 </b>
<p>
Add a service interface and implementing class in their respective files. Include a findById method that accepts a Long parameter for the id, and returns a Contact object. The implemented method can return null for now. Be sure to annotate the appropriate class or interface so that the Spring Framework detects the service.</p>
