<b>Challenge</b>
<p>In the ContactDao interface, add a findAll method that returns a List of Contact objects. Then, in ContactDaoImpl.java implement the interface and annotate the class so that's it's picked up with component scanning by Spring. The implemented findAll method can return null for now.</p>
